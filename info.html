                        <div class=bot>
                            <span>Color information is lost in this step, for the best output the foreground and background should stay clearly seperated</span>
                            <span>The default algorithm is often sufficient, and if you want to focus the red/green/blue colors more the second option should be enough</span>
                            <span>The last option is for extreme use cases, trying to seperate similar colors as background and foreground, or can just be fun to play around with</span>
                            <span>To pick a color for this option you can click and drag on the images above or input the HEX value directly in the color bar</span>
                            <span>The grayscale is based on each colors distance to both the chosen foreground and background, the closer to the foreground the lighter, the closer to the background the darker</span>
                            <span>The WRAP/CUT option applies to colors distant from both the foreground and background, when wrapping them they fade to a gray, when cutting them they are fully white/black, based on the closest color</span>
                            <span>Color distance isnt an objective measure, <a target=_blank href="http://zschuessler.github.io/DeltaE/learn">Delta E 94</a> is used to estimate the perceived color distance, there's a better algorithm available but it's much slower</span>
                            <span>When the foreground and background are very close to each other almost all other colors will either be wrapped or cut, leading to very extreme results</span>

                            <span>The color sliders are HSV values, saturation makes it lighter, value makes it darker</span>
                            <span>To input a precise color the HEX value top right can be used for input, conversion to and from HSV leads to slight imprecisions but it shouldn't be perceivable in the output</span>

                            <span>Inverse effectively swaps the chosen foreground and background colors</span>
                            <span>The double bottom slider respectively refers to the dark and light of the output, increasing dark makes the background more prominent while increasing light makes the foreground more prominent</span>
                            <span>Contrast applies a <a target=_blank href="https://javascript.info/bezier-curve">cubic bezier</a> to the transition from background to foreground, this often has a similar effect to bringing both dark and light closer together, although there is a subtle difference</span>

                            <span>You cannot press back while delayed download is selected to prevent forgetting to save a delayed download, you will automatically go back once you save, or you can select one of the other options to go back, you can also always use the top icons for navigation</span>

                            <span>Collages generate based on similar widths or heights among the images, for a better collage scaling all images to the same width or height is recommended</span>
                            <span>The longer the estimated processing time the more memory used and the larger the size of the file(s) downloaded, if this is too much the process might fail entirely</span>
                            <span>The estimated processing time is based on the performance with the previews and gets less accurate the more the actual output sizes differ from those previewed, it does not include downloading time</span>
